# Cryptography---Encryption-and-Decryption-Algorithms


This project is a comprehensive implementation of various encryption and decryption techniques and algorithms, making it a valuable learning tool for understanding cryptography. Developed in C, it demonstrates the working principles of the following ciphers:

1. Affine Cipher
2. Caesar Cipher
3. Hill Cipher
4. Playfair Cipher
5. XOR Cipher
6. RSA Encryption
7. Vigen√®re Cipher


Features: 

Educational Focus:   Each algorithm is implemented to clearly demonstrate how it works, making it suitable for learning purposes.
Message Encryption/Decryption: Encrypt and decrypt messages directly using the included ciphers.
C Language Implementation: All algorithms are written in C, showcasing their practical implementation in a low-level programming language.
This project is ideal for anyone looking to explore classical and modern cryptographic techniques, whether for educational or practical purposes.
